	If you configure the locale and register the locale data as explained in the
	<a href="https://angular.io/guide/i18n">i18n guide</a>, the month picker will honor the locale and use months names
	from the locale data. You can however provide a custom service, as demonstrated in this example, to customize the
	months names the way you want to.
